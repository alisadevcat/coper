                            The world today revolves around online interaction,
                            with over 80% of the population utilising various
                            online services. However, there's a common need that
                            unites everyone: money. Regardless of religion,
                            race, or language, everyone requires financial means
                            for various purposes. Yet often, there's a crucial
                            shortage of funds when needed most.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p gutterbottom">
                            For instance, someone might need money to pay rent
                            or buy groceries, while for others, it's essential
                            capital for a startup. In a world where you can book
                            a round-the-world trip from home, why not have a
                            service where people can help each other in
                            difficult times? That's precisely what Coper offers!
                            After a quick registration, you can access
                            micro-loans provided by other participants,
                            bypassing banking checks. On the platform, both
                            borrowers and lenders register for mutually
                            beneficial cooperation.

                            Coper is the future of financial services, where
                            your credit rating isn't as crucial as your ability
                            to lend a hand or receive help when needed.

                            Coper was created by a team of promising developers
                            forced to leave Russia due to their disagreement
                            with the war unleashed by the Russian government in
                            Ukraine. Facing challenges in finding a new home and
                            bureaucratic hurdles in settling elsewhere, Coper
                            emerged from the collaboration and results of
                            adapting to a new life beyond their homeland.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p gutterbottom">
                            The idea behind Coper arose from adapting to life in
                            a new environment, where people strive to help each
                            other and contribute to society. The name "Coper" is
                            a contraction of "Cooperation," emphasizing
                            interaction and support. Through their struggles,
                            the project's creators realized that the quickest
                            way to solve problems is to turn to specific
                            individuals, friends, comrades, rather than abstract
                            organizations that might put you on a waiting list.
                            Only a specific person here and now can help solve
                            an urgent problem quickly and without unnecessary
                            questions.

                            We aim to create a platform that unites people to
                            provide assistance and support in various aspects of
                            life, especially in challenging times. From
                            supporting small businesses in Africa to helping

                            On one hand, our service isn't just about
                            facilitating credit cooperation between two specific
                            individuals but also about providing assistance and
                            support when needed. We're creating a service that
                            helps small businesses, students, mothers, fathers,
                            cultural and artistic figures in their hour of need,
                            serving all layers of society, regardless of race,
                            nationality, citizenship, or religion.

                            opportunity to earn above-market returns but also
                            allows individuals to feel involved in doing

                            support in difficult times. After all, for someone,
                            100 euros might be just a casino bet they'll lose
                            with a 50% chance, while for someone else, such as a
                            small business owner in an African country, it could
                            be their weekly turnover, which could grow into
                            something more significant thanks to timely
                            investments. Project Coper is a cooperation platform
                            born out of the need for help and support in
                            difficult times. We bring people together, offering
                            the opportunity to assist small businesses,
                            students, families, and other segments of society.
                            Our mission is to promote cooperation and create
                            good deeds that benefit the entire world.
